    <p>The story of the first cube</p>

<p>Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.</p>

<p>He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered olivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in jars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows the taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons too. Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin&#39;s parade. And Mastiansky with the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in Citron&#39;s basketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume. Always the same, year after year. They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times. Must be without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees. There&#39;s whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do you? Doesn&#39;t see. Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore. His back is like that Norwegian captain&#39;s. Wonder if I&#39;ll meet him today. Watering cart. To provoke the rain. On earth as it is in heaven.</p>

<p>A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.</p>

<p>No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead names. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore the oldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy&#39;s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old woman&#39;s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.</p>

<p>Desolation.</p>
